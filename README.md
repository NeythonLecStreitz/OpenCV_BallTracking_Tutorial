# OpenCV BallTracking Tutorial
In this tutorial, I created a script to detect, localize, and track a colored ball using the OpenCV computer vision Python library.
As output, the script show the screen with a detected ball and a contrail following the movement of the ball.
Additionally, the script generates a .svg file with a plot of Theta vs. Time (the ball's angular velocity) and a .csv file with the ball's X and Y coordinates plus time and theta values.

The libraries required for this tutorial include NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Pandas, and imutils.
These exact requirements are specified in the requirements.txt file.
